The "dvstats" utility is used to obtain statistics about a PowerPC
program which has been translated using "dtest".  Its usage is

         dvstats [flags] <cnts_file> [<info_dir>]

where <cnts_file> must have a ".vliw_perf_ins_cnts" suffix, and contain
counts of the number of times each VLIW instruction was executed.
(The ".vliw_perf_ins_cnts" suffix need not be specified.)  The
The <cnts_file> should be automatically produced by running "dtest".

The <info_dir> is where information about each instruction
is placed by "dtest" for use here. 

Valid flags are "-b#", "-c", ,"-e", "-p", and "-s".  Dynamic opcode
frequencies are always produced.  The "-p" flag causes a ".pdf" file
to be created.  This ".pdf" file contains profile-directed-feedback
information.  The "-c" flag turns off generation of the .cnts file
(which can be very large).  The "-e" flag controls how the ".exits"
file is generated. (This file is generated for "dvstats" only).  By
default the ".exits" file is sorted by frequency of group exit.  (Each
group is a tree of VLIW tree instructions.)  With the "-e" flag, the
".exits" file is sorted by the VLIW at the entry point of a group.  In
this way it can be determined how many of the paths through the group
tree are actually exercised.  The "-b#" flag is used to specify the
degree of branch correlation used in producing the ".condbr" file.
The value must be non-negative and less than 16.

Several output files are produced from an executable file "foo":

foo.histo:      Histograms (both textual and graphical) of the
                number of operations executed per VLIW instruction.
                Useful for determining ILP achieved.

foo.exits:      A list of the paths in each VLIW group, and the
                ILP attained on each.  Useful for finding areas
                where compiler is deficient.

foo.cnts:       Lists the number of times each VLIW instruction

foo.pops1:      A list of opcode frequencies in decreasing order
                of use.  These frequencies are those of operations
                on the taken path through a VLIW instruction.

foo.sops1:      A list of opcode frequencies in decreasing order
                of use.  These frequencies are those of operations
                on all paths through a VLIW instruction.
